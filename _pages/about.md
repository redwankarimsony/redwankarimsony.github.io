I am **Redwan Sony**, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at [Michigan State University (MSU)](https://msu.edu/). I am currently a Research Assistant in the iPRoBe Lab, where I work under the guidance of [Prof. Arun Ross](https://rossarun.wixsite.com/arun-ross).

I obtained my B.Sc. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/) from the [Islamic University of Technology (IUT)](https://iutoic-dhaka.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2017. Following graduation, I joined IUT as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, where I served until July 2021. I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at [MSU]((https://msu.edu/)) in 2023 and am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the same department.

My research interests include facial and **forensic biometrics**, **model visualization**, and **explainability** in deep learning.
