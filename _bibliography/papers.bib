  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract    = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit superior performance in various machine learning tasks, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, biometric recognition, object detection, etc. However, it is essential to analyze their sensitivity to parameter perturbations before deploying them in real-world applications. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters. The sensitivity analysis involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling), and two settings (entire network and layer-wise). We perform experiments in the context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. Based on the sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by  perturbing parameters of the network without undergoing training. We further combine these perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the performance over the original model. The ensemble at the parameter-level shows an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on the
LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset. },

  title={Performance Comparison of Feature Descriptors in Offline Signature Verification},
  author={Rahman, ABM and Karim, MD and Kushol, Rafsanjany and Kabir, Md Hasanul},
  journal={IUT Journal of Engineering and Technology (JET)},
  abstract = {Handwritten Signature is a widely used biometric in daily life as a mean of identity verification of an individual. For offline signature verification both accuracy and speed are important parameters. Accuracy may vary as the samples from signature datasets show a high intra-class variability. As these properties depend on the feature descriptor taken to represent the signature image, this selection is very important. In this study we provide a comparative performance evaluation of wellknown histogram based descriptors like SIFT and SURF and a wide variety of binary descriptors like BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK in the application of handwritten signature verification. We compare the performance of these feature descriptors against speed and accuracy. After the experimental analysis we have observed that binary features like ORB is faster with moderate accuracy but SIFT-like descriptors give better accuracy. Among them the combination of FAST feature detection and BRIEF descriptor is the fastest one but with lowest accuracy.},
